Leveraging the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, the project aims to provide investors with more accurate and reliable predictions of future volatility levels.

### Objectives:
- Develop a robust framework for estimating stock market volatility.
- Evaluate the performance of the GARCH model in predicting volatility.
  
### Methodology:
The project utilizes the GARCH model, a powerful statistical tool for volatility forecasting. The methodology involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
